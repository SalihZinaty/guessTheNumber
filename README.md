React native app, made for learning the basics of react native.<br>
how to use the basic components on react native like: Views, Text, Touchable, Stylesheet.<br>
this app used also React Hooks in functional components instead of using the class component approach.<br>

# App Logic
you will give the app a number, and the app must guess this number.<br>
the user will enter of the phone guess is lower or higher than the number entered<br>
at the end, will be a game over screen that will summarize how many guesses the phone made untill it got the right number and a button to start a new game<br>
